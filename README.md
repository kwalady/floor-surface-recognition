# floor-surface-recognition

In this project, i tried to create a solution for Kaggle CareerCon 2019 competition using Long Short-Term Memory. we are provided data collected from Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors) while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces on the university premises. The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity.
